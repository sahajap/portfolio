        <p>
            Blueprints for Pangaea is a non-profit organization with chapters all across the country that redistributes excess medical supplies from large

        <h2>MECC Consulting Group</h2>
        <p>
            As a consultant at MECC, I've worked on two different projects: one with a local health center and one with a bakery franchise.
            Both projects have been strategy focused and research heavy. The first project dealt more with data analytics and the second project
            was more marketing focused, through both a social media and graphic design lens.

        <h2>TEDXUofM</h2>
        <p>I've adored TED talks ever since I was young, and at TEDXUofM, I was able to help put on a conference to bring that same
            joy to those who attended the conference. I helped design the theme reveal and interactive labs and also worked with one of our
            performers.  </p>

        <h2>Phi Chi Theta Business Fraternity</h2>
        <p>I'm currently pledging PCT, a business fraternity. Through this process, I've grown immensely as a person, by 
            building my networking skills, developing professional knowledge, and being a part of a wonderful family on campus. 
            This process has pushed me to manage my time effectively, while building new relationships.

        <p>I've been playing for as long as I can remember. Club tennis is a wonderful co-ed team, and I've built so many
            fantastic memories with my fellow teammates.
